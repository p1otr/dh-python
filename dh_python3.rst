DESCRIPTION

QUICK GUIDE FOR MAINTAINERS
---------------------------

 * build depend on dh-python
 * build-depend on python3 (Python application) or python3-all (Python module)
   or python3-all-dev (Python extension),
 * if necessary, describe supported Python 3 versions via X-Python3-Version field
   in debian/control,
 * build module/application using its standard build system (pybuild wrapper
   recommended, see pybuild.1 for more details), remember to build extensions
   for all supported Python 3 versions (loop over ``py3versions -vr``),
 * install files to the *standard* locations, add `--install-layout=deb` to
   setup.py's install command if your package is using distutils,
 * add `python3` to dh's --with option, or:
 * `include /usr/share/cdbs/1/class/python-distutils.mk` in debian/rules and
   depend on `cdbs (>= 0.4.90)`, or:
 * call ``dh_python3`` in the `binary-*` target,
 * add `${python3:Depends}` to Depends

NOTES
-----

dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~
dh_python3 tries to translate Python dependencies from `Requires-Dist`
entries in `dist-info` or `requires.txt` contents in `egg-info` to
Debian dependencies.
In many cases, this works without any additional configuration because
dh_python3 comes with a build-in mapping of Python module names to
Debian packages that is periodically regenerated from the Debian
archive. By default, the version information in the Python dependencies is
discarded. If you want dh_python3 to generate more strict dependencies (e.g. to
avoid ABI problems), or if the automatic mapping does not work correctly for
your package, you have to provide dh_python3 with additional rules for the
translation of Python module to Debian package dependencies.

For a package *python3-foo* that depends on a package *python3-bar*, there are
two files that may provide such rules:

#. If the *python3-foo* source package ships with a
   `debian/py3dist-overrides` file, this file is used by dh_python3
   during the build of *python3-foo*.

#. If the *python3-bar* source package ships with a
   `debian/python3-bar.pydist` file (and uses dh_python3), this file
   will be included in the binary package as
   `/usr/share/dh-python/dist/cpython3/python3-bar`. During the build
   of *python3-foo*, dh_python3 will then find and use the file.

Both files have the same format described in
`/usr/share/doc/dh-python/README.PyDist`. If all you want is to generate
versioned dependencies (and assuming that the *python3-bar* package provides
the *pybar* Python module), in most cases it will be sufficient to put the line
``pybar python3-bar; PEP386`` into either of the above files.

private dirs
~~~~~~~~~~~~
`/usr/share/foo`, `/usr/share/games/foo`, `/usr/lib/foo` and
`/usr/lib/games/foo` private directories are scanned for Python files
by default (where `foo` is binary package name). If your package ships
Python files in some other directory, add another dh_python3 call in
debian/rules with directory name as an argument - you can use different set of
options in this call. If you need to change options (f.e. a list of supported
Python 3 versions) for a private directory that is checked by default, invoke
dh_python3 with --skip-private option and add another call with a path to this
directory and new options.

debug packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In binary packages which name ends with `-dbg`, all files in
`/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/` directory 
that have extensions different than `so` or `h` are removed by default.
Use --no-dbg-cleaning option to disable this feature.

pyinstall files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Files listed in debian/pkg.pyinstall file will be installed as public modules
(i.e. into .../dist-packages/ directory) for all requested Python versions.

Syntax: ``path/to/file [VERSION_RANGE] [NAMESPACE]``

debian directory is automatically removed from the path, so you can place your
files in debian/ directory and install them from this location (if you want to
install them in "debian" namespace, set NAMESPACE to debian). If NAMESPACE is
set, all listed files will be installed in .../dist-packages/NAMESPACE/
directory.

Examples:
 * ``foo.py`` installs .../dist-packages/foo.py for all supported Python versions
 * ``foo/bar.py 3.3-`` installs .../dist-packages/foo/bar.py for versions >= 3.3
 * ``foo/bar.py spam`` installs .../dist-packages/spam/bar.py
 * ``debian/*.py spam.egg 3.2`` installs .../python3.2/dist-packages/spam/egg/\*.py
   files

pyremove files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to remove some public modules (i.e. files in .../dist-packages/
directory) installed by build system (from all supported Python versions or
only from a subset of these versions), add them to debian/{pkg-name}.pyremove file.

Examples:
 * ``*.pth`` removes .pth files from .../dist-packages/
 * ``bar/baz.py 3.2`` removes .../python3.2/dist-packages/bar/baz.py

bcep files
~~~~~~~~~~
Byte-compilation exception patterns can be described in these files. Use it if
you want py3compile to skip specific files. This is the only way to skip .py
files in …/dist-packages/ directory (as `--exclude` passed to py3compile in
postinst is not used in rtupdate scripts and thus this option cannot be used
for non-private modules).

``re|-3.6|/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/jinja2|.*/async(foo|bar).py``
will skip byte-compilation of `asyncfoo.py` and `asyncbar.py` in
`/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/jinja2/` directory for each interpreter that
doesn't support `async` keyword (introduced in Python 3.6).

If you want to skip byte-compilation in a subdirectory for all interpreters, use:
``dir|-4.0|/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/foo/tests/``.
VERSION_RANGE (`-4.0` in the example) is described in `README.PyDist` file.

`debian/python3-foo.bcep` file from source package will be included in the
binary package as `/usr/share/python3/bcep/python3-foo.bcep`

overriding supported / default Python versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to override system's list of supported Python versions or the
default one (f.e. to build a package that includes symlinks for older version
of Python or compile .py files only for given interpreter version), you can do
that via `DEBPYTHON3_SUPPORTED` and/or `DEBPYTHON3_DEFAULT` env. variables.

Example: ``3.2,3.3`` limits the list of supported Python versions to Python 3.2
and Python 3.3.
